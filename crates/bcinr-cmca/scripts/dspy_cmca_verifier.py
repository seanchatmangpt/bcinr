"""A real, optional LLM-based third-party verifier for CMCA allocations,
built the way DSPy's own GEPA trusted-monitor tutorial (dspy.ai/tutorials/
gepa_trusted_monitor/) builds a monitor: an independent judge scoring how
suspicious a claimed allocation is against a reference allocation, never
trusting the actor's own report. Adapted directly from
`gymact.dspy_verifier.DspyTrustedMonitorVerifier` (see
`/Users/sac/gymact/src/gymact/dspy_verifier.py`) -- same shape, same
request-scoped `dspy.LM(...)` + `dspy.context(lm=lm)` pattern, same default
judge model and threshold, retargeted from generic expected/observed dicts
to `reference_allocation`/`claimed_allocation` dicts produced by the real
`cmca_allocate_cli` binary.

Importing this module never fails when the optional `dspy` extra isn't
installed -- `SuspicionOfAllocationMismatch` is only defined when `dspy`
really is importable; constructing `CmcaAllocationVerifier` without it
raises a real, named `ImportError` with install guidance, matching
`gymact.dspy_verifier`'s own optional-dependency discipline.
