//! Arbitrary-arity, arbitrary-depth multifractal consequence cascade.
//!
//! # Why this exists alongside [`crate::allocator`]
//!
//! [`crate::allocator::allocate`] is the *certified* cascade: branchless
//! ($CC=1$), allocation-free, side-channel resilient -- and, as the price of
//! those properties, hard-bounded to `N = 8` nodes and depth `<= 8`
//! (`parent[x & 7]`, eight literal `flow_step` calls) with a single scalar `q`
//! applied identically at every level. Those bounds are not a defect of that
//! function; they are what make it constant-time. Widening it would destroy
//! the property that justifies it.
//!
//! This module is the *analysis* cascade: it allocates, it branches, and in
//! exchange it takes a tree of any shape and a **lens per level**. It is meant
//! for structural allocation over a real hierarchy (e.g. a POWL 2.0 process
//! tree, whose depth and arity are set by the process, not by a register
//! width), not for a hot control loop. Both compute the same measure; pick by
//! whether you need the constant-time guarantee or the unbounded shape.
//!
//! # The measure
//!
//! At each parent `p` with children `c_1..c_k`, the local *escort*
//! distribution at lens `q` is
//!
//! ```text
//!   L_q(c_i | p) = m(c_i)^q / SUM_j m(c_j)^q
//! ```
//!
//! and a node's consequence mass is the product down its root path:
//!
//! ```text
//!   pi(v) = PRODUCT over edges (p -> c) on root..v of L_q(c | p)
//! ```
//!
//! This is a multiplicative cascade of escort measures -- the standard
//! multifractal construction. What makes it genuinely *multi*fractal rather
//! than one global exponent is that `q` is read **per depth**: `lenses[d]`
//! applies to nodes at depth `d`. A single-element `lenses` slice reproduces
//! the monofractal, one-exponent behaviour of the certified path.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! Lenses are integers, and `m^q` is computed by repeated `saturating_mul`
//! (and one `saturating_div` for negative `q`) over Q16.16
//! `NonNegativeFixed` -- no `powf`, no libm, no floating point anywhere. The
//! result is bit-identical on every platform, exactly as the certified path
//! is. Integer lenses are not a restriction in practice: the lens vocabulary
//! this crate is built around (exploitation `2`, proportional `1`, coverage
//! `0`, rare `-1`) is already integral.
