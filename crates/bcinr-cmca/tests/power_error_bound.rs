//! Error-bound characterization for `allocator::power`'s fractional-lens
//! path.
//!
//! # Scope and relationship to checkpoint E
//!
//! `lean_correspondence.rs` (checkpoint E) named this gap explicitly and
//! declared it out of scope: `escort.rs`'s own
//! `power_disagrees_with_the_exact_path_at_a_measured_bound` measured a
//! ~1.07% relative drift at `q=3` on normalized *shares* (post-sum,
//! post-division) for one small mass set, against the exact
//! `cascade::escort_weight` repeated-multiplication path -- diagnostic
//! evidence, not a domain-wide characterization, and explicitly flagged as
//! future work by both that test's own doc comment and checkpoint E's
//! module doc.
//!
//! This file is that future work: a domain-wide, reproducible bound on
//! `allocator::power`'s *own* relative error against a high-precision
//! (`f64`) reference oracle (`base.powf(q)`), not against
//! `escort_weight`'s normalized shares. Bounding `power` itself is the
//! right level -- `escort.rs`'s ~1.07% figure mixes `power`'s error with
//! cancellation/amplification from summation and division, which depends
//! on the mass set chosen and is not a property of `power` alone.
//!
//! # Method: empirical sweep, not analytical derivation
//!
//! `power(base, exponent) = exp2(exponent * log2(base))`
//! (`crates/bcinr-cmca/src/allocator/mod.rs`, `power`). Both `log2`
//! (`fixed.rs::NonNegativeFixed::log2`) and `exp2`
//! (`fixed.rs::SignedFixed::exp2`) are fixed-point polynomial
//! approximations over the mantissa/fractional part: `log2` applies one
//! quadratic Newton-style correction to a linear mantissa estimate,
//! `exp2` evaluates a degree-4 polynomial in the fractional exponent
//! bits. Composing two polynomial approximations and reasoning about the
//! resulting error analytically (a Taylor remainder bound composed
//! through a multiplication and a second approximation) is a real
//! derivation, not a checkpoint-sized one -- so this checkpoint takes the
//! empirical path the task brief explicitly allows as an honest
//! substitute: an exhaustive, finite, documented grid sweep against
//! `f64`, with the exact sweep parameters recorded below so the bound is
//! reproducible and falsifiable. **This is an EMPIRICAL bound, not an
//! analytically proven one.**
//!
//! # A real finding this sweep surfaced: error scales with `|q|`
//!
//! An initial sweep across the *entire* declared lens domain
//! (`cascade::MAX_LENS_MAGNITUDE == 16`, i.e. `q in [-16,16]`) measured a
//! maximum relative error of ~48.5% -- because `log2`'s small absolute
//! approximation error gets multiplied by `exponent` *before* `exp2`
//! exponentiates it, so the error grows roughly with `|q|`, not with
//! `base`. Bucketing by `|q|` confirms this is monotonic, not a corner
//! case:
//!
//! | `|q|` range   | max relative error (measured) |
//! |---------------|-------------------------------|
//! | `(0, 0.25]`   | 0.5%                           |
//! | `(0.25, 1]`   | 1.5%                           |
//! | `(1, 2]`      | 3.5%                           |
//! | `(2, 4]`      | 7.6%                           |
//! | `(4, 8]`      | 16.4%                          |
//! | `(8, 16]`     | 36.2%                          |
//!
//! A single bound over the full `[-16, 16]` domain would therefore have
//! to be as loose as ~40-50% to be honest -- not a useful
//! characterization for the tight-precision uses this crate's own tests
//! exercise. Per this repo's own Gall-checkpoint discipline ("one
//! consequential distinction ... no unrelated architectural expansion"),
//! this checkpoint *primarily* bounds a genuinely useful, tighter
//! sub-domain: **`|q| <= 4`**, which covers every worked example this
//! crate's own tests already use (`escort.rs`'s `q=3` diagnostic test,
//! `q(0.5)`/`q(-0.5)`/`q(1.0)`/`q(2.0)`/`q(4.0)`/`q(5.0)` in `escort.rs`'s
//! `output_sums_to_approximately_one` and
//! `higher_q_concentrates_mass_on_the_largest_input`).
//!
//! `power` remains reachable at `|q|` up to `MAX_LENS_MAGNITUDE` (16)
//! through `escort_distribution`, and CMCA-106 closed the gap this
//! paragraph used to leave open: the full `4 < |q| <= 16` sub-domain is
//! **no longer `UNKNOWN`**. `power_relative_error_full_domain_bucketed`
//! below sweeps the entire admitted domain (`|q| <= 16`) with the same
//! grid construction as the `|q| <= 4` sweep, extended, and asserts a
//! real, per-bucket measured bound (see that test's own doc comment for
//! the exact figures: growing from ~0.5% at `|q| <= 0.25` to ~36.2% at
//! `|q| <= 16`, with the exact boundary `|q| == 16` measured directly at
//! ~36.9%). The `|q| <= 4` sweep and bound below remain as the tighter,
//! separately-asserted characterization for the sub-domain this crate's
//! own worked examples actually use -- both bounds are checked
//! independently, and neither supersedes the other.
//!
//! # Domain swept (the bound this file actually asserts)
//!
//! - `base`: 60 points, geometrically spaced from `2^-6` (~0.0156) to
//!   `2^10` (1024) -- several orders of magnitude around the `[0.1, 10]`
//!   masses `escort.rs`'s own tests use, with headroom on both sides.
//!   `base == 0` is excluded -- `power` treats it as an exact special
//!   case (no `log2`/`exp2` approximation involved; see `power`'s
//!   `base_is_zero` branch), outside the approximation error surface
//!   this file characterizes.
//! - `exponent` (`q`): every `0.25`-step point in `[-4, 4]` that is NOT
//!   an exact integer -- integer `q` never reaches `power` through the
//!   public `escort_distribution` entry point (`exact_integer_lens`
//!   routes it to `cascade::escort_weight` instead), so this file only
//!   sweeps inputs `power` is actually reachable on in production use.
//! - Reference values with `|base.powf(q)| < 0.01` are excluded: at that
//!   magnitude the true answer is within ~65 Q16.16 units of zero, so
//!   *relative* error is dominated by fixed-point quantization noise (the
//!   representation's ~1.5e-5 resolution floor), not by the
//!   `log2`/`exp2` approximation this file characterizes. This is a
//!   measurement-methodology exclusion, confirmed by direct
//!   inspection (a `base=5.3, q=-6.25` case outside the `|q|<=4` domain
//!   showed a "48% relative error" driven entirely by a true answer of
//!   `2.96e-5`, i.e. ~2 representable units) -- not a way to hide real
//!   approximation error.
//! - Any `(base, exponent)` pair where `power` itself signals a numeric
//!   fault (`err != u32::MAX`) is excluded from the statistic -- a
//!   refused value is not a silently wrong value, and
//!   `escort_distribution` already turns that fault into
//!   `EscortRefusal::NumericFault` rather than propagating it.
//!
//! # Result
//!
//! Maximum observed relative error over the swept `|q| <= 4` grid: ~7.6%
//! at the domain's edge (`|q|` near 4, small `base`). See
//! `EMPIRICAL_RELATIVE_ERROR_BOUND` for the bound asserted (measured
//! maximum plus headroom) and the sweep test's own `eprintln!` for the
//! exact figure on any given run.
