//! Fractional-exponent escort distribution: `L_q(i) = p_i^q / SUM_j p_j^q`,
//! for real-valued `q`.
//!
//! # Ancestry
//!
//! This normalized-power construction is not novel to this crate. It is an
//! *escort mapping* -- see Harper, "Escort Evolutionary Game Theory"
//! (Physica D, 2009), which develops escort maps `phi(x) = x^q` over the
//! simplex, escort replicator dynamics, and the `q == 0` orthogonal-projection
//! special case -- and the exponent `q` plays the role of a multifractal
//! partition-sum exponent, per Halsey, Jensen, Kadanoff, Procaccia & Shraiman,
//! "Fractal measures and their singularities" (Phys. Rev. A, 1986), where
//! varying `q` shifts which subset of a measure dominates a partition sum
//! `chi(q) = sum_i p_i^q`.
//!
//! What this crate adds on top of that ancestry: a fixed five-lens reference
//! profile -- now hand-transcribed (not machine-checked; see
//! [`crate::reference_escort`]) from `~/mfw`'s
//! `MFW/CMCA/Semantics/Escort.lean` (`CMCA-Escort-v0.1`) -- typed refusals
//! instead of silent degradation, a fixed-point (not floating-point)
//! realization, an explicit declared lens domain (below), integration with
//! [`crate::cascade`]'s hierarchical allocation, and a semantic decision
//! between *support coverage* (uniform over positive-mass support only,
//! excluding zero-mass elements -- Lean's `ReferenceLens.coverage`) and
//! *sibling coverage* (uniform over every eligible sibling, zero-mass
//! included -- Lean's `uniformSiblingCoverage`). **Current BCINR behavior is
//! sibling coverage**: [`crate::cascade::escort_weight`]'s `lens == 0`
//! branch returns `NonNegativeFixed::ONE` unconditionally, regardless of
//! mass, so a zero-mass sibling gets the same weight as every other one.
//! This is now checked, not merely asserted: on zero-containing mass
//! fields, `escort_distribution(masses, q=0)` matches
//! `reference_escort::uniform_sibling_coverage(masses)` within a measured
//! Q16.16 tolerance, and does NOT match
//! `reference_escort::escort(Coverage, masses)` on the same inputs -- see
//! `crates/bcinr-cmca/tests/cmca_h_lean_correspondence.rs`,
//! `q_zero_on_zero_containing_masses_matches_sibling_coverage_not_support_coverage`.
//! That test held on every case exercised: BCINR's `q = 0` behavior is
//! sibling coverage, not support coverage, exactly as this paragraph
//! claims. This is a differential-test correspondence result, not a formal
//! or machine-checked proof -- there is no FFI or export bridge between
//! `~/mfw`'s Lean repository and this Rust crate, and `reference_escort`
//! is itself a hand-transcription of the Lean definitions, not a generated
//! or verified artifact. The citation above documents mathematical
//! ancestry; the correspondence tests document checked (not proven)
//! agreement with the Lean reference oracle.
//!
//! # Relationship to `cascade::escort_weight` and `allocator::power`
//!
//! [`crate::cascade::escort_weight`] computes `m^q` exactly, by repeated
//! `saturating_mul` -- but only for integer `q` (`lens: i32`), and that
//! module's own docs are explicit that this is deliberate: "no `powf`, no
//! libm, no floating point anywhere... bit-identical on every platform."
//! `escort_distribution` now dispatches to it automatically whenever `q`
//! has no fractional part: an integer lens never reaches the approximate
//! path, regardless of which entry point a caller uses.
//!
//! [`crate::allocator::power`] remains this module's fallback for genuinely
//! fractional `q` (e.g. `q = 0.5` or `q = -0.5`) -- a branchless
//! `base^exponent` via fixed-point `log2`/`exp2` approximation, at the real
//! cost of being an approximation, not the exact, bit-identical repeated
//! multiplication `escort_weight` gives you for integer lenses. Measured,
//! not assumed: at `q = 3` over a small representative mass set, the two
//! disagree by up to 704/65536 (~1.07% relative) per share -- see
//! `tests::power_disagrees_with_the_exact_path_at_a_measured_bound`. A
//! domain-wide characterization of `power`'s own relative error (not
//! mixed with normalization cancellation, as this single-share figure
//! is) now exists in `tests/power_error_bound.rs`: an empirical, swept
//! bound of ~7.6% relative error for `|q| <= 4`, with error measured to
//! grow with `|q|`. `power` is reachable through the public
//! `escort_distribution` API across the crate's *entire* declared lens
//! domain (`|q| <= cascade::MAX_LENS_MAGNITUDE == 16`, checked by
//! `escort_distribution`'s own bound check just below) -- so that full
//! domain, not just `|q| <= 4`, is now also swept and bounded, by
//! `power_relative_error_full_domain_bucketed` in
//! `tests/power_error_bound.rs`: max relative error grows from ~0.5% for
//! `|q| <= 0.25` to ~1.5% for `|q| <= 1`, ~3.5% for `|q| <= 2`, ~7.6% for
//! `|q| <= 4` (matching the sub-domain figure above), ~16.4% for
//! `|q| <= 8`, and ~36.2% for `|q| <= 16`, with the exact boundary
//! `|q| == 16` measured directly at ~36.9%. Every figure here is a real,
//! reproducible measurement against an `f64` reference oracle over a
//! fixed grid, not an assumption -- see that test's own module doc and
//! `eprintln!` output for the exact grid and current numbers.
//!
//! **CMCA-116 closure**: ~36-37% relative error at `|q|` near 16 is large
//! enough that a caller relying on `power`'s output there for anything more
//! precise than "roughly which sibling dominates" should not trust the
//! magnitude, and `escort_distribution` gave no signal by which to tell a
//! high-error call from a low-error one. Rather than narrowing the admitted
//! domain (which would refuse calls that work fine today), this measured
//! bucketed error data is now exposed as a runtime-checkable
//! [`PathConfidence`] via the additive
//! [`escort_distribution_with_confidence`] entry point, so a caller can
//! decide for itself whether a given call's error bound is acceptable --
//! without changing `escort_distribution`'s existing `Ok`/`Err` signature
//! or behavior for any existing caller.
//!
//! # Declared lens domain
//!
//! `escort_distribution` refuses any `q` whose magnitude exceeds
//! [`crate::cascade::MAX_LENS_MAGNITUDE`] -- the same bound
//! `cascade::escort_weight` enforces for integer lenses, now applied to
//! fractional `q` too. This is a provisional domain, not one derived from a
//! specification: before this gate existed, this module silently accepted
//! any `SignedFixed` and either produced an answer or saturated without
//! signaling it. Expect this bound to be superseded once `~/mfw`'s
//! `ReferenceLens` fixes the admitted domain formally.
