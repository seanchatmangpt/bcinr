//! Machine Learning Fairness Audit
//!
//! Demonstrates how CMCA's deterministic, conservation-respecting allocation
//! gives auditors a checkable fairness guarantee when allocating GPU/compute
//! time to competing ML models — something ad-hoc round-robin or priority
//! queues cannot prove.
//!
//! ## The Problem
//!
//! ML systems need to allocate compute fairly across competing models:
//! - Training multiple models simultaneously on shared GPU
//! - Preventing starvation (every model gets sufficient training time)
//! - Proving fairness to auditors (regulatory compliance)
//!
//! Conventional systems use ad-hoc round-robin or priority queues. These
//! cannot prove fairness: "Did model X get enough training?" is unanswerable
//! from an opaque scheduler log alone.
//!
//! ## The Solution
//!
//! CMCA's `allocate()` returns a per-candidate weight vector that (a) is
//! reproducible from published inputs (an auditor can replay it), (b) never
//! starves a candidate with nonzero factors (every `result[i].val > 0`), and
//! (c) conserves total allocated capacity to ~1.0 in Q16.16 fixed point. The
//! tests below check these three properties directly against the real
//! allocation output, not merely that the call returned `Ok`.
