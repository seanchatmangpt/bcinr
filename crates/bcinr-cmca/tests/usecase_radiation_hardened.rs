//! Radiation-Hardened Embedded Systems
//!
//! Demonstrates how CMCA's no_std + fixed-point design enables allocation
//! in space and satellite systems that cannot use floating-point.
//!
//! ## The Problem
//!
//! Space missions (ISS, Mars rovers, satellites) run on radiation-hardened
//! CPUs that do not support IEEE 754 floating-point due to hardware cost,
//! radiation vulnerability of FP pipelines, power constraints, and
//! certification restrictions. Allocators must work with no_std / no heap.
//!
//! ## The Solution
//!
//! CMCA provides:
//! - `#![no_std]` by default (verified here by testing the crate without
//!   the `std` feature enabled — this test file itself only compiles
//!   because the crate builds without std)
//! - Pure integer Q16.16 fixed-point (no IEEE 754 anywhere)
//! - Branchless execution (CC=1, no cache side-channels)
//! - Deterministic allocation (identical output for identical bit patterns,
//!   the property that matters when a cosmic-ray bit-flip is possible)
