//! # Weighted Small-Gain Theorem: independent numeric verification
//!
//! `allocator::allocate`'s `gd_ok` check tests, at runtime, that the constants in
//! [`crate::generated::stability_profile::PROFILE`] satisfy one specific weighted-diagonal-
//! dominance inequality (for each row $i$: $\sum_j G_{ij} d_j \le (1-\delta) d_i$). That
//! inequality is the *hypothesis* of the Weighted Small-Gain Theorem the profile is named
//! after; it is not itself a check that the theorem's *conclusion* -- $\rho(G) \le 1 - \delta$,
//! where $\rho$ is the spectral radius -- actually holds for these numbers. This module
//! computes that conclusion independently, from scratch, via power iteration, rather than
//! trusting that the row-wise hypothesis and the spectral-radius conclusion agree.
//!
//! It also independently evaluates the companion average-dwell-time bound
//! $$ \tau_D > \frac{\ln(\chi_{\max})}{-\ln(1-\delta)} $$
//! against the profile's declared `minimum_dwell_rounds`.
//!
//! ## No-`std` note
//! This crate is `no_std` by default (see `lib.rs`). `core::f64` does not expose `sqrt`,
//! `ln`, or `powi` (verified: those require linking `std`/libm, unlike `+ - * /` and `.abs()`,
//! which compile to native FP instructions). Adding an external `libm` dependency is out of
//! scope here, so this module carries its own small `ln` (bit-decomposition + atanh series)
//! and avoids `sqrt` entirely by normalizing the power-iteration vector with the infinity
//! norm instead of the Euclidean norm -- valid because [`GAIN_MATRIX`] is entrywise
//! non-negative, so Perron-Frobenius power iteration converges under any vector norm.
