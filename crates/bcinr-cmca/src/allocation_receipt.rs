//! # Allocation audit-trail receipts
//!
//! `allocate` (and `allocate_in`) compute, then discard, a per-`(measure, lens)` share
//! for every candidate on the way to the single combined vector they return. Once that
//! call has returned, there is no way to answer "why did candidate X get share Y under
//! measure K at lens Q" without re-running the whole allocation by hand and diffing
//! internal state. This module is the audit-trail companion, following the same pattern
//! as `certification::seal_certificate`:
//!
//! - [`AllocationBindings`] is a typed struct enumerating every input that determined one
//!   candidate's per-`(measure, lens)` share -- the candidate's index, which measure and
//!   lens produced the share, the lens's own `q` value, and a digest of the semantic
//!   states / parent forest / MWU weights that fed the computation.
//! - [`AllocationRefusal`] is a typed refusal enum, one variant per check, including
//!   [`AllocationRefusal::Cyclic`] for a cyclic `parent` (checked via
//!   `check_hierarchy_acyclic`, mirroring `allocate_single_lens`'s
//!   `LensSelectionRefusal::Cyclic`) -- sealing or verifying over a cyclic `parent` refuses
//!   rather than silently recomputing over `ancestor_doubling_table`'s garbage topology.
//! - [`verify_allocation_receipt`] independently RECOMPUTES the share from the bindings
//!   plus the caller-supplied actual inputs -- by calling the crate's own topology
//!   (`ancestor_doubling_table`) and per-lens kernel (`compute_pi_kq_for_kq`), the exact
//!   same functions `allocate_in` itself calls -- and refuses on any mismatch rather than
//!   trusting the receipt's recorded share.
//!
//! This is purely additive: it does not touch `allocate`/`allocate_in`'s signatures,
//! return types, or hot-path behavior (the two visibility bumps this module required --
//! `ancestor_doubling_table` and `compute_pi_kq_for_kq` becoming `pub(crate)` -- change
//! nothing about what those functions compute). A caller mints a receipt with
//! [`seal_allocation_receipt`] alongside (or any time after) a normal `allocate` call,
//! using the exact `states`/`parent`/`weights` that call was given (for `weights`, the
//! array as it stood *after* the call returned -- `allocate_in` computes each candidate's
//! share from the post-MWU-update weights, not the pre-call ones; this module cannot detect
//! a caller passing the wrong snapshot, so that ordering remains a caller-discipline
//! requirement, not a checked one). Anyone later holding just the receipt and the recorded
//! inputs can call [`verify_allocation_receipt`] to independently recompute and cross-check
//! the share against those inputs -- **not** a cryptographic tamper-evidence guarantee: the
//! binding digest (`mix64`, below) is a 64-bit non-cryptographic splitmix64-style finalizer,
//! the same kind of internal audit-trail checksum `certification::seal_certificate` uses,
//! not a collision-resistant hash like `bcinr-powl`'s BLAKE3-backed `OcelCausalReceipt`. It
//! is adequate to catch accidental/incidental input drift and to structure an audit trail,
//! but a party who can freely choose both a receipt and its claimed inputs could construct a
//! digest collision; treat this module as an audit aid, not a security boundary.
