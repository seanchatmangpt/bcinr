//! Financial Trading Determinism
//!
//! Demonstrates how CMCA's deterministic allocation enables reproducible
//! high-frequency trading systems that withstand regulatory audit.
//!
//! ## The Problem
//!
//! High-frequency traders must allocate capital across market orders.
//! Conventional systems use floating-point arithmetic and randomness,
//! making execution impossible to audit or reproduce. Regulators require
//! reproducible allocation for enforcement.
//!
//! ## The Solution
//!
//! CMCA provides:
//! - Deterministic Q16.16 fixed-point (no IEEE 754 variance)
//! - No randomness source (allocation depends only on inputs)
//! - BLAKE3 receipts (auditable, tamper-evident records)
//! - Identical execution on any hardware, any CPU vendor
